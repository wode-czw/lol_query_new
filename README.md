query_rank_info_by_name is the main file ,modify the name you want ,
later I will give a gin   GUI to get the infomation.
make sure the LOL  client is active when you use this file.
the account you want to query must in the same area with your account who is logined.

查询英雄联盟的最近30把排位的熟悉英雄的召唤师信息--根据名字,id,并且会进行很多公平的计算，
评分数据会比wegame的更加可靠，因为会计算送头的的负面信息

There are several script to get infomation in cmd folder. 
1.
go run .\cmd\get_token_port\give_url_port.go
After you start the League of Legend,this code will return the token and the port of the LOL client
